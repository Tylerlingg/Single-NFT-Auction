# Single-NFT-Auction
Selling an NFT via English Auction on Ethereum Mainnet. 

Step 1: Backend? 

  Deploy English Auction contract 
  Go to NFT Token address as owner of token
  Write 'approve' function and give permissions to the Auction contract
  Go to Auction contract and use transferNFT, this will transfer the NFT to the contracts address
    *Nothing needs to be done by the deployer or token seller until the end of the auction now on the backend 
    
Step 2: Front end? 
  
  Upload the Auction contract ABI to the index.html file
  Change the contract address in that same file to the Auction contract 
  Change the image with an image that you would like. Upload the image to the same Github repo
    *Can view mine under the image file in the .io repo

Step 3: Web app functionality
  Check and make sure you're able to place a bid
  Let the contract run until the bid is over
