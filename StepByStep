Step by Step:

To smoothly run this contract as the owner of the NFT being auctioned and the one deploying the auction contract, follow these steps:

Deploy the EnglishAuction contract by providing the necessary constructor arguments:

_royaltyPercentage: The percentage of the final bid amount to be sent to the creator as royalty.
	ex: 10 = 10% of winning bid amount 
_start: The auction start timestamp.
	ex: 1682096873 (needs to be in Unix Timestamp)
_end: The auction end timestamp.
	ex: same as above
_minimumBid: The minimum amount a user must bid.
	0.0001 Ether = 100000000000000
	0.001 Ether = 1000000000000000
	0.01 Ether = 10000000000000000
	0.1 Ether = 100000000000000000
	1 Ether = 1000000000000000000
_nftAddress: The address of the NFT contract.
	ex: (insert NFT's address)
_tokenId: The token ID of the NFT to be auctioned.
	ex: tokenID
_creator: The address of the NFT creator.

_beneficiary: The address that will receive the auction proceeds.

Approve the auction contract to manage the NFT by either calling approve or setApprovalForAll on the NFT contract.

Call transferNFT to transfer the NFT from your address to the auction contract.

Allow users to place their bids by calling the placeBid function.

After the auction end time has passed, call endAuction to finalize the auction, transfer the NFT to the highest bidder, and distribute the funds to the creator and beneficiary.

If necessary, you can call withdrawExcessFunds to withdraw any remaining balance left in the contract after the auction has been finalized.

Optionally, you can reset the auction for a new token by calling resetAuction with the new start time, end time, minimum bid, and token ID.
